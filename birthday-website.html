    <h2 id="note-title">From Tasha, With All My Love</h2>
    <p id="note-content">I met you in university in 2020, and somehow you became one of the most important people in my life without either of us really trying. You’ve been one of the best parts of my last six years, and I don’t say that lightly. Knowing you, loving you, growing alongside you has been such a gift.
Watching your journey has filled me with so much pride it almost hurts. 
<br>
I’ve seen you move from dancing to TikTok trends just for fun, to modeling for small brands, to starting your crochet business and putting real love and effort into it—and then watching it work. And now, seeing you step into this new phase of your life as a full influencer—brands inviting you to events, sending you PR, people genuinely paying attention to what you create—it feels surreal. Like watching someone quietly become who they were always meant to be.
And then there’s pharmacy school. Against the odds. 
<br>
Through pressure, doubt, exhaustion, and moments where giving up would’ve been easier—you still did it. You believed in yourself when it mattered most, and that strength will never stop amazing me.
What I admire most about you is that you never stop growing. You never settle. 
<br>
You’re always learning, always evolving, always reaching for the next version of yourself. You don’t stay the same—you become more. And that’s how I know, deep in my bones, that you’re going to do amazingly well in life. Not just because you’re talented or hardworking, but because you’re brave enough to keep becoming.
I am endlessly proud of you. Proud of your courage, your discipline, your creativity, and the woman you’re turning into. Thank you for being my best friend, my safe place, my inspiration. I’m so grateful I get to witness your journey up close.
Happy birthday. 
<br>
I love you so much, and I can’t wait to see everything you’re still going to become. This is only the beginning ✨</p>
